## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Web4application/fadaka.git
cd fadaka

2. Run Blockchain Node

cd blockchain
go run ./cmd/main.go
```
3. Start API Backend (Python 3.11+)
```
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload

```
4. Serve Wallet UI
```
cd wallet-ui
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Visit http://localhost:4000 to access your Fadaka Wallet

⸻

```
🧪 Test Wallet & Faucet

To generate wallets:

```bash
cd faucet
go run ./walletgen.go

```
Send coins using faucet CLI:

```
go run ./faucet.go --to=<wallet_address>

```
🧱 Smart Contracts

Contracts are built with upgradeable logic (proxy pattern):
```

mycontract.go
cd contracts
# Build WASM or Go plugin contracts
go build -buildmode=plugin -o mycontract.so
```
```
mycontract.go
```
Contract deploy & invoke handled via api/ or raw RPC calls.
